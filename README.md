CLASS - Python
-------

NOTE: the `Makefile` for compiling `ribtol.cpp` (fast Bulk Richardson - Obukhov length iterative solver) is not required to run CLASS. By default a (somewhat slower) Python solver is used, and the fast c++ version is only interesting for computationally expensive experiments.
